# Komms: Asynchronous Communication Library for Kotlin

Komms is a Kotlin library designed to simplify and enhance asynchronous communication within your applications. It provides tools and utilities to manage asynchronous tasks, making it easier to handle concurrent operations and interactions.

## Features

*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Komms provides mechanisms to perform tasks asynchronously, improving responsiveness and efficiency.
*   **Simplified Communication:** The library aims to abstract away the complexities of asynchronous communication, making it more intuitive to use.
*   **Kotlin-First Design:** Built specifically for Kotlin, leveraging its features and idioms for a seamless developer experience.

## Getting Started

### Including Komms in Your Project (Local Development)

Since Komms is a library you're developing locally, you'll need to include it as a module in your other projects. Here's how you can do it:

**Step 1: Build Komms Locally**

1.  Open the Komms project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred IDE.
2.  In the terminal, navigate to the root directory of the Komms project.
3.  Run the following Gradle command to build the project:

````
bash ./gradlew build
````
This will compile the Komms library and generate the necessary artifacts.

**Step 2: Include Komms as a Module in Your Other Project**

1.  Open the project where you want to use Komms in IntelliJ IDEA.
2.  Go to `File` -> `New` -> `Module from Existing Sources...`.
3.  Navigate to the root directory of your Komms project and select the `build.gradle.kts` file.
4.  Click `Open` and follow the prompts to import the Komms project as a module.
5.  After the module is imported, open the `settings.gradle.kts` file of your main project.
6.  Add the following line to include the Komms module:

````
kotlin include(":Komms")
````

If the Komms project is in a different folder, you can use:

````
kotlin include(":Komms") project(":Komms").projectDir = file("../Komms")
````

Replace `../Komms` with the relative path to the Komms project.
7.  Open the `build.gradle.kts` file of your main project (the one where you want to use Komms).
8.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` block:
````
kotlin dependencies { implementation(project(":Komms")) 
// ... other dependencies
````

   
 This tells Gradle that your project depends on the Komms module.
9.  Sync your project with Gradle files. You can do this by clicking the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button (it looks like an elephant with a green arrow) in the top toolbar.

**Step 3: Start Using Komms**

Now you can import and use the classes and functions from the Komms library in your project's Kotlin code.
